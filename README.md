- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Learned the shunting yard algorithm and was able to implement it to make the calculator functional.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->
